box64 (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an option to get generated -NAN on SSE2 operation
  * Many small fixes and improvement to get SteamPlay (i.e. proton) working (along with box86)

  * Refactor Dynarec:
  *   - better handling of SSE/x87 registers
  *   - optimisation to limit float/double conversion
  *   - better handling of "internal" jump inside a dynablock
