box64 (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

This version added many important refactors: the opcode prefix decoder for Dynarec, libGL and Vulkan, the FSGSBASE support, making segments handling easier and faster.
    => Improved compatibility accross all architecture, allowing more DRM protected game to run
    => the prefix refactor helped removed lots of redundant source file, simplifying maintenance
    => BOX32 is getting more and more stable, even if still not 100% ok. But Steam is more stable than before, runs on all architecture. And some gameoverlay UI works, on OpenGL games. gameoverlay (and fossilize) support for Vulkan is planned for later.

box64 (0.3.8) unstable; urgency=low

This version introduce DynaCache, a disk cache for the generated native code. It's not enabled by default for now (but it will use cache file if present by default). It can dramaticaly speedup the load of program (try with linux factorio for example). This version also improve in the volatile metadata handling. There is a massive compatiblity improvment for box32 and on all dynarec in general too. And few more function wrapping...

    => DynaCache for faster loading of program, and avoid runtime hicups
    => Batter box32 compatibility (much less "Out of Memory" error)
    => Unity3D games on Wayland are working now
    => Volatile Metadata fully supported and handled, making games like Starfield to just work.
    => More work on AVX support for RV64 & LA64. LA64 almost there, while RV64 has Scalar only support (no hardware vector support yet for AVX)

box64 (0.3.6) unstable; urgency=low

This version introduces wowbox64.dll for Hangover; the ability to use the Volatile Metadata of Windows executables for x64 wine; and some better x87/SSE/AVX handling

    => WowBox64 can be built directly from Box64 repo, and can be found in the CI artifacts also
    => it also supports a subset of BOX64_XXXX settings, which can be set from command line or via a setting file ".box64rc" in the Wine prefix home
    => Volatile Metadata, when present, allows only applying strong memory ordering when needed, as marked by the compiler, giving overall better performances
    => The precision control bit of x87 is now handled, allowing some older games to run correctly
    => More work has been done in the handling of precise NaN and Round handling in SSE & AVX opcodes
