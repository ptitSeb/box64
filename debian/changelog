box64 (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

 * Added a hacked version for overriden malloc/free functions, enabling libcef (and derivative) to work.
 * Added rcfile handling: box64 now read "/etc/box64.box64rc" and "~/.box64rc" and apply per process parameters
 * Added BOX64_DYNAREC_CALLRET to optimized CALL/RET opcode using semi-direct native CALL/RET (get more than 10% speedup)
 * Added BOX64_DYNAREC_FORWARD to allow bigger Dynarec block to be build (can get more then 30% of Speedup!)
 * Improved memory protection tracking and signal handling, again
 * Simplified mutex handling (faster, cleaner)
 * Reduce memory used by the memory tracking (memory almost divide by 4 is some critical use case)
 * Added d3dadaptor9 wrapping
 * More wrapped libs (especially on the gtk familly)
 * Improved/fixed some Syscall handling
 * Refactored Strong Memory Model emulation (faster and more accurate)
 * Added some more opcode to ARM64 Dynarec, and fixed some other
 * Some fixes to flags handling in the Dynarec on some special cases
 * Refactor library loading/unloading, with refcount.
 * Some special cases fixes for dlopen (fixes deadcells, maybe others too)
 * Improved mmap mapping, espcially with MAP_32BITS flag
 * More wrapped functions and syscalls
 * Lots of improvment in the Rounding of float & double (Dynarec and Interpretor), and proper handling of denormals when converting to/from 80 bits long double
 * Added specific suppport for RK3588 board (needed some hack in signal handling, probably due to the use of a non mainlined kernel)
 * More support on the RV64 port
 * More support to build under musl environment
