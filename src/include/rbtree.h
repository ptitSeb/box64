/*
 * The primary function of red-black trees in Box64 is to provide an O(log n) method for managing memory mappings.
 * This provides a mechanism that allows retrieving the memory range or associated data based on an address.
 * Unlike standard red-black trees, each node here includes two additional fields, "start" and "end," to denote a specific memory range.
 *
 * Box64 currently uses seven red-black trees, each serving distinct purposes:
 * 1. memprot: 
 *    Manages memory protection settings. Each node's data field represents the permissions of its memory range.
 *    
 * 2. mapallmem: 
 *    Mirrors what’s in `/proc/self/maps`. The data field in each node can be:
 *      - MEM_ALLOCATED
 *      - MEM_RESERVED (reserved for box32_dynarec_mmap)
 *      - MEM_MMAP (indicating the range is mapped via mmap)
 * 
 * 3. blockstree: 
 *    Contains memory ranges for a free-list (blocklist_s). Each node represents a different free-list.
 *    The data field stores the index of that free-list in the array `p_blocks` (i.e., the array that holds each free-list pointer).
 * 
 *     ┌────────┬────────┬───────────────────────────────┬────────┬────────┐
 *     │ m.prev │ m.next │            PAYLOAD            │ n.prev │ n.next │
 *     │ 0      │ offs   │  (allocsize - 2·sizeof(mark)) │  offs  │  0     │
 *     └────────┴────────┴───────────────────────────────┴────────┴────────┘
 *     ↑                                                                   ↑
 *     p (free-list start)                                      p + allocsize (free-list end)
 * 
 * 4. db_sizes:
 *    Tracks, for each dynablock size, how many dynablocks of exactly that size currently exist (per-size count).
 * 
 * 5. envmap:
 *    Maps each live memory range to its mapping_t, which contains:
 *      - the file’s lowercase name,
 *      - a pointer to that file’s per-file box64env_t,
 *      - and the base address;
 *    indicating which module owns that range.
 * 
 * 6. rbt_dynmem: 
 *    Contains memory ranges for a different free-list (chunks) used by dynamic blocks. Each node represents one chunk.
 *    The data field stores the index of that chunk in the array mmaplist_t.
 *    
 *    [ mmaplist0 ] → [ mmaplist1 ] → [ mmaplist2 ] → …  
 *          │              │              │  
 *      chunks[0]      chunks[0]      chunks[0]    (each chunk[i] is a blocklist_t)  
 *      chunks[1]      chunks[1]      chunks[1]  
 *        ...            ...            ...  
 *      chunks[63]     chunks[63]     chunks[63]  
 * 
 * 7. volatileRanges: 
 *    Tracks every “volatile” region inside a loaded PE module. 
 *
 * Before the introduction of the red-black tree in Box64, the rationale for memory management was a sparse array, which takes O(n) complexity for accessing data.
 * After transitioning from a sparse array to a red-black tree, the memory usage has decreased slightly for processes that consumed a lot of RAM (for example, Steam uses about 100 MB less memory, and each Wine process uses about 15 MB less).
 *
 * Note that each rbnode is allocated by a bitmap allocator (map128_customMalloc), which provides 128 bytes of space for any request <128 bytes.
 * Since each rbtree node is 56 bytes, this results in 72 bytes of internal fragmentation per node. There is therefore a trade-off when using rbtree.
