/*
 * The primary function of red-black trees in Box64 is to provide a fast and efficient method (O(log(n))) for managing memory mappings. 
 * Each red-black tree node includes two additional pointers, "start" and "end," to denote a specific memory range. 
 * When a range of memory is mapped from the system, it is recorded in red-black trees based on the type and characteristics of that memory range.
 *
 * Box64 utilizes four red-black trees, each serving distinct purposes:
 * 1. memprot: Manages memory protection settings where each node's data field represents the permissions of the memory range. 
 *    The "rb_set" function within this tree can set or change permissions for a specified range.
 * 2. mapallmem: Tracks all memory mappings. Its nodes' data field can indicate whether the memory is included in this mapping.
 * 3. mmapmem: Similar to "mapallmem" but specifically for memory mapped through the mmap system call. 
 *    The nodes' data fields here differentiate whether the memory is exclusively mapped by mmap.
 * 4. blockstree: Specifically contains memory ranges for blocks, where each node represents a different block. 
 *    The "data" field in this tree represents the index of the block in the "blocklist_s" array "p_blocks".
 *
 * Currently, there is an overlap between "mapallmem" and "mmapmem", where if memory is mapped in "mmapmem", it is also considered mapped in "mapallmem". 
 * If "mapallmem" and "mmapmem" were to be merged in the future, the "data" field could then take values indicating:
 * - 0: Memory is not mapped.
 * - 1: Memory is only mapped in "mapallmem".
 * - 2: Memory is mapped in both "mapallmem" and "mmapmem".
 * 
 * Before the introduction of the red-black tree in Box64, the rationale for memory management was a sparse array, which takes O(n) complexity for accessing data.
 * After transitioning from a sparse array to a red-black tree, the memory usage has decreased slightly for processes that consumed a lot of RAM (for example, Steam uses about 100 MB less memory, and each Wine process uses about 15 MB less).
