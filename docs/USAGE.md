#### BOX64_LIBGL
 * libXXXX set the name for libGL (defaults to libGL.so.1).
 * /PATH/TO/libGLXXX : Sets the name and path for libGL
 You can also use SDL_VIDEO_GL_DRIVER

#### BOX64_LD_PRELOAD
 * XXXX[:YYYYY] force loading XXXX (and YYYY...) libraries with the binary
 PreLoaded libs can be emulated or native, and are treated the same way as if they were comming from the binary
 
#### BOX64_EMULATED_LIBS
 * XXXX[:YYYYY] force lib XXXX (and YYYY...) to be emulated (and not wrapped)
Some games uses an old version of some libraries, with an ABI incompatible with native version.
Note that LittleInferno for example is auto detected, and libvorbis.so.0 is automatical added to emulated libs, and same for Don't Starve (and Together / Server variant) that use an old SDL2 too

#### BOX64_ALLOWMISSINGLIBS
Allow Box64 to continue even if a library is missing.
 * 0 : Box64 will stop if a library cannot be loaded. (Default.)
 * 1 : Continue even if a needed library cannot be loaded. Unadvised, this will, in most cases, crash later on.

#### BOX64_PREFER_WRAPPED
Box64 will use wrapped libs even if the lib is specified with absolute path
 * 0 : Try to use emulated libs when they are defined with absolute path  (Default.)
 * 1 : Use Wrapped native libs even if path is absolute

#### BOX64_PREFER_EMULATED
Box64 will prefer emulated libs first (execpt for glibc, alsa, pulse, GL, vulkan and X11
 * 0 : Native libs are prefered (Default.)
 * 1 : Emulated libs are prefered (Default for program running inside pressure-vessel)

#### BOX64_NOPULSE
Disables the load of pulseaudio libraries.

 * 1 : Disables the load of pulse audio libraries (libpulse and libpulse-simple), both the native library and the x86 library

#### BOX64_NOGTK
Disables the loading of wrapped GTK libraries.
 * 0 : Load wrapped GTK libraries if found. (Default.)
 * 1 : Disables loading wrapped GTK libraries.

#### BOX64_NOVULKAN
Disables the load of vulkan libraries.
 * 0 : Load vulkan libraries if found.
 * 1 : Disables the load of vulkan libraries, both the native and the i386 version (can be useful on Pi4, where the vulkan driver is not quite there yet.)

#### BOX64_BASH
Define x86_64 bash to launch script
 * yyyy
 Will use yyyy as x86_64 bash to launch script. yyyy needs to be a full path to a valid x86_64 version of bash

#### BOX64_ENV
 * XXX=yyyy
 will add XXX=yyyy env. var.

#### BOX64_ENV1
 * XXX=yyyy
 will add XXX=yyyy env. var. and continue with BOX86_ENV2 ... until var doesn't exist

#### BOX64_JITGDB
 * 0 : Just print the Segfault message on segfault (default)
 * 1 : Launch `gdb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 When in gdb, you need to find the correct thread yourself (the one with `my_box64signalhandler` in is stack)
 then probably need to `finish` 1 or 2 functions (inside `usleep(..)`) and then you'll be in `my_box64signalhandler`, 
 just before the printf of the Segfault message. Then simply 
 `set waiting=0` to exit the infinite loop.
 * 2 : Launch `gdbserver` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process, and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 Use `gdb /PATH/TO/box64` and then `target remote 127.0.0.1:1234` to connect to the gdbserver (or use actual IP if not on the machine). After that, the procedure is the same as with ` BOX64_JITGDB=1`.
 This mode can be usefullwhen programs redirect all console output to a file (like Unity3D Games)
