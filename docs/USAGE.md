
Usage
----

There are multiple environment variables to control Box64 behaviour.

### Configuration files

Env. vars below marked with * can also be put inside box64rc file, with priority over command line environment.
Box64 looks for 2 places for rcfile: `/etc/box64.box64rc` and `~/.box64rc`.
The second takes precedence over the first per each application (when `[MYAPP]` appears in both files, only the settings in `~/.box64rc` will be applied).
Asterisks may be used to denote a substring in the application name, like `[*setup*]` that will be applied to every program containing "setup" in its name. Note that this is not a complete set of regex rules.
Settings priority: `~/.box64rc` > `/etc/box64.box64rc` > Command line.

### Debugging

#### BOX64_LOG *

Set the level of box64 logs.
 * 0: NONE : No messages (except for a few fatal errors). (default)
 * 1: INFO : Minimum log (Example: missing libraries)
 * 2: DEBUG : Verbose log (Example: relocations or functions called).
 * 3: DUMP : All DEBUG plus DUMP of all ELF Info.

#### BOX64_ROLLING_LOG *

Show last few wrapped function call when a Signal is caught.
 * 0: No last function call printed (default)
 * 1: Print last 16 wrapped functions calls when a signal is caught. Incompatible with BOX64_LOG>1 (may need BOX64_SHOWSEGV=1)
 * N: Print last N wrapped functions calls when a signal is caught. Incompatible with BOX64_LOG>1 (may need BOX64_SHOWSEGV=1)

#### BOX64_NOBANNER

Disables printing box64 version and build.
 * 0 : Print the banner. (default)
 * 1 : Do not print the banner. 

#### BOX64_DLSYM_ERROR *

Enable logging of `dlsym` errors.
 * 0 : Do not print `dlsym` errors. (default)
 * 1 : Print dlsym errors.

#### BOX64_TRACE_FILE *

Send all log and trace to a file instead of `stdout`.
File name syntax:
 * `%pid` in the name is replaced with the actual PID of box64 instance.
 * Use `+` in the end of the name to append instead of overwriting.
 * `stderr` can be used instead of default `stdout` 

#### BOX64_SHOWSEGV *

Always show Segfault signal.
 * 0 : Do not force show the SIGSEGV if a signal handler is present. (default)
 * 1 : Show SIGSEGV detail, even if a signal handler is present.

#### BOX64_SHOWBT *

Show some backtrace (native and emulated) when a signal (SEGV, ILL or BUS) is caught.
 * 0 : Do not show backtraces. (default)
 * 1 : Show Backtrace details (for native, box64 is renamed as the x86_64 binary runs).

#### BOX64_NOSIGSEGV *

Disable handling of SigSEGV for debugging.
 * 0 : Let the x86 program set sighandler for SEGV. (default)
 * 1 : Disable the handling of SigSEGV.

#### BOX64_NOSIGILL *

Disable handling of SigILL for debugging.
 * 0 : Let x86 program set sighandler for Illegal Instruction.

#### BOX64_JITGDB *

 * 0 : Just print the Segfault message when the signal is caught. (default)
 * 1 : Launch `gdb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 When in gdb, you need to find the correct thread yourself (the one with `my_box64signalhandler` in is stack)
 then probably need to `finish` 1 or 2 functions (inside `usleep(..)`) and then you'll be in `my_box64signalhandler`, 
 just before the printf of the Segfault message. Then simply 
 `set waiting=0` to exit the infinite loop.
 * 2 : Launch `gdbserver` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process, and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 Use `gdb /PATH/TO/box64` and then `target remote 127.0.0.1:1234` to connect to the gdbserver (or use actual IP if not on the machine). After that, the procedure is the same as with ` BOX64_JITGDB=1`.
 This mode can be usefull when programs redirect all console output to a file (like Unity3D Games)
 * 3 : Launch `lldb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.

#### BOX64_TRACE *
