
Usage
----

There are many environment variables to control Box64 behaviour. 
Env. var with * can also be put inside box64rc files. 
Box64 look for 2 places for rcfile: `/etc/box64.box64rc` and `~/.box64rc`
The second takes precedence to the first, on an APP level 
(that means if an [MYAPP] my appears in both file, only the settings in `~/.box64rc` will be applied)

#### BOX64_LOG *

* 1 : Try to reserve (without allocating it) memory beyond 47bits (seems unstable)

#### BOX64_JITGDB *
 * 0 : Just print the Segfault message on segfault (default)
 * 1 : Launch `gdb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 When in gdb, you need to find the correct thread yourself (the one with `my_box64signalhandler` in is stack)
 then probably need to `finish` 1 or 2 functions (inside `usleep(..)`) and then you'll be in `my_box64signalhandler`, 
 just before the printf of the Segfault message. Then simply 
 `set waiting=0` to exit the infinite loop.
 * 2 : Launch `gdbserver` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process, and go in an endless loop, waiting.
 Use `gdb /PATH/TO/box64` and then `target remote 127.0.0.1:1234` to connect to the gdbserver (or use actual IP if not on the machine). After that, the procedure is the same as with ` BOX64_JITGDB=1`.
 This mode can be usefullwhen programs redirect all console output to a file (like Unity3D Games)
 * 3 : Launch `lldb` when a segfault, bus error or illegal instruction signal is trapped, attached to the offending process and go in an endless loop, waiting.

#### BOX64_NORCFILES
If the env var exist, no rc files (like /etc/box64.box64rc and ~/.box64rc) will be loaded

#### BOX64_RCFILE
If the env var is set and file exists, this variable will be used as path to the box64rc file instead of default paths (BOX64_RCFILE is loaded first, default paths are not loaded)
