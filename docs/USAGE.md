Usage
----

There are many environment variables to control Box64's behaviour, which will be listed below by category.

There are 2 types of Box64 builds: the Wine WOW64 build (WowBox64) and the regular Linux build. Beware only some of the environment variables are available in WowBox64.

### Configuration files

In addition to environment variables, if you're using the regular Linux build, Box64 also looks for 2 places for rcfile by default: the system-wide `/etc/box64.box64rc` and user-specific `~/.box64rc`.
While in WowBox64, the configuration file is checked at `%USERPROFILE%/.box64rc` only.
Settings priority follows this order (from highest to lowest): `~/.box64rc` > `/etc/box64.box64rc` > environment variables.

Example configuration:

```
[factorio]
BOX64_DYNAREC_SAFEFLAGS=0
BOX64_DYNAREC_BIGBLOCK=2
BOX64_DYNAREC_FORWARD=1024
BOX64_DYNAREC_CALLRET=1
```

This configuration will apply the specified settings application-wide to any executable named `factorio`.

### Advanced usage for Linux build

1. **Wildcard Matching**

   Asterisks (`*`) can be used for basic pattern matching in application names. For instance, `[*setup*]` will match any program containing "setup" in its name. Note this implements simple wildcard matching rather than full regex support.
2. **Custom Configuration File**

   The `BOX64_RCFILE` environment variable can specify an alternative configuration file instead of the default `/etc/box64.box64rc`.
3. **Per-File Settings**

   Sections starting with `/` apply to specific files. For example:
   ```
   [/d3d9.dll]
   BOX64_DYNAREC_SAFEFLAGS=0
   ```
   These settings will only affect the `d3d9.dll` file. This syntax also works for **emulated** Linux libraries, e.g., `[/libstdc++.so.6]`.
