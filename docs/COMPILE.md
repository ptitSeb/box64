Compiling/Installing
----

#### Debian-based Linux 
You can use [@ryanfortner](https://github.com/ryanfortner)'s apt repository to install precompiled box64 debs, updated every 24 hours. 

```
sudo wget https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/box64.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box64.list
wget -qO- https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/box64-debs-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo apt update && sudo apt install box64 -y
```

Alternatively, you can generate your own package using the [instructions below](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md#debian-packaging). 

#### for RK3399

Using a 64bit OS:
```
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64
cd box64
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DRK3399=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make -j4
sudo make install
```
If it's the first install, you also need:
```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt
```

#### for RK3588 / RK3588S

Using a 64bit OS:
```
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64
cd box64
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DRK3588=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make -j4
sudo make install
```
If it's the first install, you also need:
```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt
```

#### for Raspberry Pi 3

Warning, you need a 64bit OS:

If building on the Pi, you will also need a large swap (3 GB+)
[optionally reduce GPU memory to a minimum (e.g. 16 MB) using `raspi-config`
(and reboot) before starting the build]:

You can use e.g. '`make -j4`' to speed up the build, but on a Pi 3 with 1GB memory you will likely
run out of memory at some point and need to run the build again.
Still, this can be faster if your build is attended.

```
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64
cd box64

#### for Other ARM64 Linux platforms

 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DARM_DYNAREC=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make -j$(nproc)`

You can also add `-DBAD_SIGNAL=ON` to the cmake command if you are on Linux Kernel mixed with Android, like on RK3588 or maybe Termux

#### for x86_64 Linux

 `mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DLD80BITS=1 -DNOALIGN=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo; make -j$(nproc)`

If you encounter some linking errors, try using `NOLOADADDR=ON` (`cmake -DNOLOADADDR=ON; make -j$(nproc)`).

### use ccmake

Alternatively, you can **use the curses-bases ccmake (or any other gui frontend for cmake)** to select wich platform to use interactively.

### Customize your build

#### Use ccache if you have it

Add `-DUSE_CCACHE=1` if you have ccache (it's better if you plan to touch the sources)

#### To have some debug info

The `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` argument makes a build that is both optimized for speed, and has debug information embedded. That way, if you have a crash or try to analyse performance, you'll have some symbols.

#### To have a Trace Enabled build 

To have a trace enabled build (***the interpreter will be slightly slower***), add `-DHAVE_TRACE=1`. But you will need to have the [Zydis library](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis) in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or in the system library folders at runtime. Use version v3.2.1, as later version changed the API and will no longer work with box64

#### To have ARM Dynarec

Dynarec is only available on ARM (for the meantime), Activate it by using `-DARM_DYNAREC=1`.
###### *Note: VFPv3 and NEON are required for Dynarec.*

#### Not building from a git clone

If you are not building from a git clone (for example, downloading a release source code zip from github), you need to use `-DNOGIT=1` from cmake to be able to build (box64 uses git SHA1 to show last commit in version number).

----

Testing
----
A few tests are included with box64.

They can be launched using the `ctest` command.

The tests are very basic and only tests some functionality for now.

----

Debian Packaging
----
Box64 can also be packaged into a .deb file ***using the source code zip from the releases page*** with `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc`. Configure any additional cmake options you might want in `debian/rules`.
