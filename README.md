Box64 enables running x86_64 Linux programs, including games, on non-x86_64 Linux systems such as Arm (64-bit little-endian host system required).

Check out Box64 in action on YouTube:
- [MicroLinux](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwFQAEj1lp3out4n7BeBatQ)
- [Pi Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgfQjdc5RceRlTGfuthBs7g)
- [The Byteman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEr8lpIJ3B5Ctc5BvcOHSnA)

Box64 leverages native system libraries (libc, libm, SDL, OpenGL), offering ease of integration and surprising performance in many applications. For performance benchmarks, check [this analysis](https://box86.org/index.php/2021/06/game-performances/).

With DynaRec for ARM64, RV64 and LA64 platforms, Box64 achieves a speed boost 5-10x faster than the interpreter alone. For a deeper look at DynaRec, see [Inner workings](https://box86.org/2021/07/inner-workings-a-high%e2%80%91level-view-of-box86-and-a-low%e2%80%91level-view-of-the-dynarec/).

## üîÑ Version History

See the [Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for version updates.

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Compatibility Notes

Box64 requires 64-bit libraries on the host system, as it directly translates x86_64 function calls. For 32-bit binaries, use Box86.

**Notes** 

1. Box32 mode is in the making, which aims to support 32-bit binaries on Box64, stay tuned!
2. Some installers may default to x86 on 64-bit host OSes, causing compatibility issues. Workaround: Use a fake `uname` that returns "x86_64" for `-m`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Box64 has configuration files located in `/etc/box64.box64rc` and `~/.box64rc`, both formatted as `.ini` files. If you don‚Äôt want to use the default `/etc/box64.box64rc` file, copy it to `~/.box64rc` to ensure compatibility.

Settings priority: `~/.box64rc` > `/etc/box64.box64rc` > Command line.

## üìÑ Additional Platform-Specific Notes

### Unity Game Emulation

- Many Unity games require OpenGL 3+, which may be challenging on ARM/RISC-V SBCs.
- **Tip for Pi4 and Pi5 Users**: Set `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2` with `BOX64_DYNAREC_STRONGMEM=1` to prevent freezes and enable strong memory mode.
- **Using Panfrost**: For better compatibility on ARM, enable `PAN_MESA_DEBUG=gl3` to force higher OpenGL profiles. This can help if a game starts but quits unexpectedly before showing any content.

### GTK Programs

Box64 wraps GTK libraries, supporting both gtk2 and gtk3.

### Steam

Steam requires Box86 due to its 32-bit client app, but uses 64-bit local server binaries. Systems with less than 6GB RAM may need a swap file for optimal performance.

### Wine

Box64 supports Wine64 and Proton. For 32-bit components, Box86 is required. Systems with both Box64 and Box86 can run 32- and 64-bit Windows programs.

**Note**: You can use Wine WOW64 build to run x86 Windows programs in Box64-only environments, this is still experimental, but it works in most cases.

### Vulkan

Box64 wraps Vulkan libraries.
